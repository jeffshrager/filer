---------------------------------------------------------------

Filer is a filename pattern matcher and rebuilder (see -? notes,
below). The matchpattern is compared with the files in the current
directory (see -d option) and output to standard out, as described
below.  Under most circumstances, you'll want to quote the patterns
because filers uses special characters (* ' and ?), which will do the
wrong thing in a command line if you don't quote them.

***WARNING*** Filer is both very useful and very dangerous.  Before
you either pipe the produced commands to a shell for execution, be
absolutely sure that it's going do what you want, or you might end up
making a mess of your directory.  I take no responsibility for messes
made by the program!  (See disclaimer, above)

usage: [-c command] [-m match-pattern] [-r rebuilding-pattern]
       (see other options, below)

Filer builds lists of files, or lists of shell commands with file agrs.
The files are pattern-matched from the current directory.

In the match, * matches an arbitrary string, ? matches an arbitrary char.
In rebuilding: * or ? may be followed by 'n (n=1-9) to indicate which
               wild card char to replace.
   (double quoted patterns are recommended because of the use of * ? ', etc.)
                'd[yYmdHM] inserts the indicated time:
                  'dY - insert the full year (1995)
                    y - short year (95)
                    m - month (01 thru 12)
                    d - day after first of the month (01 thru 31)
                    s - standard (yyyymmdd as: 19950922)
                   
                    H - hours (00 thru 23)
                    M - minutes (00 thru 59)
                    t - time (hhmm)

Example: filer -c cp -m \"*b*\" -r \"*'2b*'1\"
Will turn: 'abc' into 'cba', etc.

Actually, Filer just creates the cp commands to do that, you'll have to pipe
the commands to shell in order to get them to really happen.  You can do this
either by direct pipe to your favorite shell, or by collecting them (e.g., by >)
into a file and then running them in batch via source, submit, etc.

Options summary:

   -m <pattern>       matching pattern
   -r <pattern>       rebuilding pattern
   -c <command>       a command to prefix to resulting matches and rebuilds
   -d <path>          directory in which to do matches
                      (gets prepended to match patterns in built commands)
   -a                 include files that begin with a period (.)

/*

Things that need to be done:

-g, -e, -v options: -e means "eval", that is, do the commands and
don't bother piping them to cout (unless -v is given).  If -e is given
without -g ("go"), then the user is prompted (yes, no, go) for each
command.  -v ("verify") is given with -e, then the commands are both
executed *and* sent to cout.

-i read from cin instead of getting the current dir's files.

Mod: I don't think that * requiring at least one char is right.  Maybe
replace that with + and make * be zero-min.

Mod: Think about replaces -c -m and -r with just one, two, or three
args (second and third optional).

Mike Worden wants arbitrary math.  This is a good idea.  Maybe add a
"'#" match char which, on the other end you can do simple things to,
like '#+  or  '#- to add one or subtract one (if I really wanted to
get fancy I could permit things like '#(+5/(#-4))...  Next lifetime.
